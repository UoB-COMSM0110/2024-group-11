v0.2（2.6）：

	This update introduces a score recording feature, and gold coins will randomly appear during the game for players to collect. The current score is displayed in real-time during gameplay (one point is added for avoiding a pipe, and five points are added for collecting a gold coin). The game over screen displays the score for the current session and the highest score (the highest score is not saved locally and will be reset to zero upon exiting the program).
