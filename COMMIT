Game Idea 1: Flappy Bird Name: Chameleon Chase 
In this version of Flappy Bird, the pipes and the bird are dynamically changing colors. 
The twist is that the player must control the bird to match its color with the upcoming pipes to pass through them.
The second twist is that the pipes move dynamically to trap the bird.
The third twist is that there are two players and the two players each control a racing bird (whose speed can be adjusted by the arrow keys)

Game Idea 2: BrickBreaker

In "Pixel Bouncer," the classic brick breaker game takes a twist with a pixelated, retro aesthetic. 
Players control a bouncing pixel ball with the goal of breaking colorful pixel bricks in a dynamic and evolving environment. 
The twist comes with the introduction of various power-ups, challenging obstacles, and a unique bouncing mechanic.
The speed and direction of the balls can be adjusted by the area of the paddle stricken with. Hitting  CERTAIN moving animal ends the game. 
There are multiple mitating levels of increasing difficulty and hitting a certain ball can reverse direction, change ball size, and reverse
gravity. 

Game Idea 3: NS-Shaft

In the game, a player can control the left and right direction keys to move to the left or right. 
As the platform continues to rise, the goal is to allow the player to go down the maximum number of floors.
The player has a total of 12 points of health. If contacting the spikes on the ceiling or the spike platform, 
he will receive negative points of damage. 
When the player is injured by the spikes on the ceiling, he will be forced to leave the platform and jump down. 
The game ends when the health point reaches zero or when the player falls to the bottom.
