- I'm Mike, 58M, haven't been excersing for years as I just drive everywhere - the new app has been a gamechanger for me - now I excercise 3x a week and my Blood pressure and heart rate has decreased
- I'm Emily, 35F, I used to go to the gym in my home-town every day after work, but the commute here takes too long and I don't have time when I get home as it's dark - running to work in the morning
has been great as I now have an opportunity to exercise. It's great to feel like I;ve done something before work
- I'm James, 20M, I am interning at this company, and I love the work culture - everyone is very fit and active and it has motivated me to balance excercise alongside my studies. In the office everyone
has started a competition to see who can cover the most distance each week, and the winner gets a prize at the end of the year. I'm gonna try work my way up this leaderboard!
