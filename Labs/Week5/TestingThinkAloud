Task 1: GamePlay Evaluation 
Objective: Assess the player's ability to control the bird and navigate through the pipes
Tests: The player can move the bird, the player can collect a coin, the player can evade a pipe, the player can change the bird's colour
Overall Test: Players should be able to achieve a score of 10 within 5 attempts (reasonable difficulty level)


Task 2: Usability and UI Evaluation
Objective: Evaluate the usability and user interface of the game
Tests: The player can start the game, view the high score, and the player can restart the game
Overall test: The game is played more than once

We will not give the participants any information on the game beyond what is provided in the settings. If the participant cannot move the bird
after 60 seconds, we will explain the space bar moves the bird in single-player and the up-arrow and spacebar in multiplayer

We will record every instance we needed to give information during the evaluation and record the time taken for the player to adapt to the 
game (achieve a score of 10) and note the player's reactions/feelings during the game 

Participants A and B had no prior knowledge of the game 

Results: It took Participant A 13 seconds to figure out how to control the bird
It took the player 21 seconds to collect their first coin but had no issues with understanding the objective 
They were able to go to the menu and change the bird's colour easily. 
They achieved a score of 23 on their second attempt. 
They liked the colour change to tell them one life was gone but noted it was difficult to tell that hitting the pipe would not lead to
instant death. They liked the fact that designs were variable every time a new game was started. They liked the fact there was a learning 
curve associated with the game. They found it easy to restart the game and could view the high score instantly 

Participant B was then recruited and was not told any information about the game by Participant A. They were given the same tasks but in
The two-player game. Participant A figured out that it was colour-coded as to which pipes to avoid after 25s. They noted it would be 
useful to know which colour player 1 and player 2 was. Participant B still couldn't change the bird's colour after 84 seconds of gameplay. 
They felt as though the game could've used some collision logic where the players bounce off of each other.

Both wondered what would happen if the 2 birds in the multi-player were the same colour.

Participant C was recruited following this to test the game, they were able to figure out the usability of the game, but first thought the
arrow key would move the bird, then enter, and finally realised it was the keyboard. They were unsure how to switch to multiplayer. They
recommended a manual page or instructions to make the usability of the game controls clearer and the option to switch to 2-player.
