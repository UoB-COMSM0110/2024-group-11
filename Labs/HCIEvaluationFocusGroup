Participant A

Think Aloud (Easy)
- Compelling Design: like the buttons and how they pop out (easy to use), like the changing of colours
- Would be nice if the bird was more animated
- Sometimes the game doesn't respond right after crashing (can see 2 copies of Bird)
- Likes that there is a pause, and then you die after hitting the pipes 
- Likes that if you immediately die, there is a shielding effect

Think Aloud (Hard)
- It would be nice if the bird responded to the speed of pressing the space bar
- Very replayable - keeps wanting to play again

Two-Player
- Likes the music
- Likes the sound effects
- Says it is fun
- Can't pause/exit
