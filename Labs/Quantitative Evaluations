Calculating SUS
Step 1: Convert the user ratings from the 10 questions into points

For odd numbered questions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9:

    [User Rating] – 1 = ___ points

For even-numbered questions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10:

    5 – [User Rating] = ___ points

Step 2: Add up the points from the 10 questions into a user’s total points

    [Question 1: __ points] + [Question 2: ___ points] + … [ Question 10: ___ points]  = ____ total points from user 1

Step 3: Multiply the user’s total points X 2.5* to get an individual user’s score. 
*This converts the scale to be out of 100. 

    [Total points from user 1] x 2.5 = User #1 score

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 for all users, and then average all user’s Scores together to get a SUS score:

    User #1 score + user #2 score + user #3 + [etc.]  / # of users = SUS Score
