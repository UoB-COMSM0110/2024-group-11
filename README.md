# Game ideas:
## Game Idea 1: Flappy Bird Name: Chameleon Chase 
In this version of Flappy Bird, the pipes and the bird are dynamically changing colors. 
The twist is that the player must control the bird to match its color with the upcoming pipes to pass through them.
The second twist is that the pipes move dynamically to trap the bird.
The third twist is that there are two players and the two players each control a racing bird (whose speed can be adjusted by the arrow keys)

## Game Idea 2: BrickBreaker

In "Pixel Bouncer," the classic brick breaker game takes a twist with a pixelated, retro aesthetic. 
Players control a bouncing pixel ball with the goal of breaking colorful pixel bricks in a dynamic and evolving environment. 
The twist comes with the introduction of various power-ups, challenging obstacles, and a unique bouncing mechanic.
The speed and direction of the balls can be adjusted by the area of the paddle stricken with. Hitting  CERTAIN moving animal ends the game. 
There are multiple mitating levels of increasing difficulty and hitting a certain ball can reverse direction, change ball size, and reverse
gravity. 

## Game Idea 3: NS-Shaft

In the game, a player can control the left and right direction keys to move to the left or right. 
As the platform continues to rise, the goal is to allow the player to go down the maximum number of floors.
The player has a total of 12 points of health. If contacting the spikes on the ceiling or the spike platform, 
he will receive negative points of damage. 
When the player is injured by the spikes on the ceiling, he will be forced to leave the platform and jump down. 
The game ends when the health point reaches zero or when the player falls to the bottom.

  Twist:
  Items appear randomly to allow the player to restore health points or change the platform on the field.

  Challenges: 
  1. Implementing dynamic behaviors for various platforms (ordinary, fake, spring, crawler, spiked) and ensuring precise collision detection.
  2. Managing the health system and accurately calculating damage from spiked platforms.
  3. Balancing difficulty across platform types, adjusting spiked platform frequency, and the speed of the rising platform.

## Reflection
Through the use of user stories and use cases, our team learned the importance of understanding and addressing the specific needs of different stakeholders. We discovered the value of clear, concise user stories in guiding the development process and translating these stories into actionable development tasks. Moreover, we learned how to detail system functionalities and behaviors through use cases, ensuring a shared understanding among team members. This process enhanced communication, increased project transparency, and made our development efforts more efficient and goal-oriented. Additionally, we recognized the importance of continuous feedback to adjust user stories and use cases timely, ensuring the final product genuinely meets user needs.

## Think Aloud
Two tasks:
1.Change bird color.
2.Get 20 points.

Critical Moments:
1.Start the game directly and cannot find the setting.
2.Don't know how to move.
3.Get used to using the mouse for ascending operations rather than the keyboard.
4.No awareness of avoiding obstacles.
5.Have the awareness to take the initiative to eat gold coins.
6.The game will not always be in a floating state. It will tend to be at the top or bottom as long as it is guaranteed not to die.

## Challenges
Challenge 1: Collision Detection.
In our game, there are four different entities: the player-controlled bird, pipes, coins, and eagles. Handling the collisions between these is an important part of our game. Initially, I thought to use double dispatch to implement this feature, but after writing the collision interface and completing the bird-pipe collision detection methods, I found this to be superfluous. In reality, only the bird colliding with pipes, coins, and eagles occurs in the game. Using double dispatch would lead to some methods that would never be implemented. Thus, I abandoned double dispatch and simplified collision detection to circle-to-circle collision detection (bird with coins and eagles) and circle-to-rectangle collision detection (bird with pipes). Circle-to-circle collision detection is simple, only requiring checking whether the distance between the centers of the two circles is less than the sum of their radii. However, circle-to-rectangle detection is more complex, first requiring the identification of the closest point on the rectangle to the circle, and then determining if the distance from this point to the circle's center is greater than the radius of the circle. This challenge is more of a test of mathematical knowledge, but after spending some time to understand the principles, the coding implementation was straightforward.
ï»¿
Challenge 2: Bird Transit Through Screen Borders.
In the early versions of the game, the bird could not fly out of the top or fall out of the bottom of the window. Observing other teams' members experiencing our game, they would often keep the bird on the floor for a long time as an easy way to dodge pipes. So, I decided to modify the game mechanics to allow the bird to transition between the top and bottom borders of the screen: when the bird falls off the screen at the bottom, it would reappear from the top, and vice versa. Implementing this feature took quite some time. To make the animation look smooth, I ensured that the part of the bird disappearing from one side of the screen and the part appearing on the other side were always complementary. After the bird's body completely left the screen, its position would be adjusted to the opposite side of the screen. This required changes not only to the existing method of displaying the bird but also to the collision detection methods (the bird should have collision detection for both parts during transit), and the death animation of the bird (after the bird dies, it should not appear from the top when it falls off the bottom of the screen). After a long time and numerous tests and adjustments, the effect finally met my satisfaction.
ï»¿
Challenge 3: Two-Player Mode.
The two-player mode is a highlight of our team's game, allowing two players to choose birds of different colors to play together and avoid pipes that match their own bird's color. After completing the single-player mode, we began to implement the two-player mode. The implementation of the two-player mode is not as simple as just adding another bird entity; it accompanies many new features and adjustments to existing code. This includes adjustments to the pipe generation frequency: the highest in single-player mode, followed by the two-player mode with birds of different colors, and finally, the two-player mode with birds of the same color, as it's necessary to lower the game difficulty if players have the same color and need to avoid all pipes. Adjustments to the eagle behavior are also necessary: in two-player mode, if both players are alive, the eagle will always attempt to lock onto a different player each time. Additionally, there are adjustments to the player input method; inputs from two players can occur simultaneously, and the original method could cause key conflicts, making one player's actions undetectable, requiring other methods to implement this function. The game's end conditions also need modification; when one player dies, the other should be able to continue playing, among other things.
